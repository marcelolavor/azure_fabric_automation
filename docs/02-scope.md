# Azure Fabric Automation Documentation

## Scope

The scope of this Change Management initiative includes:

- **In Scope**
  - Microsoft Fabric workspaces, capacities, and items (datasets, reports, pipelines, lakehouses, warehouses).
  - Azure resources related to Fabric usage (Storage Accounts, Key Vaults, Networking).
  - Resources provisioned manually, via portal, or legacy Terraform implementations.

- **Out of Scope**
  - Non-critical temporary resources used for sandbox testing.
  - Personal workspaces without business impact (to be assessed case by case).

This scope may evolve as additional governance requirements are identified during the migration process.
