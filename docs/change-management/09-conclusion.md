# Azure Fabric Automation Documentation

## Conclusion

This Change Management process ensures that the **Terraform adoption in Microsoft Fabric** is executed in a structured, auditable, and risk-free manner.

By introducing a **Staging layer**, the organisation gains:

- Full visibility of existing resources.
- Controlled incremental migration.
- Enforcement of corporate naming conventions and tagging.
- Integration with governance committees for approvals.

Ultimately, this framework enables a **scalable and resilient governance model**, aligning Fabric infrastructure with industry best practices and corporate compliance requirements.
